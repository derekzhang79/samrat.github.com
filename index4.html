	</hgroup>
	<p>After reading <a href="http://blog.zachwaugh.com/post/9666969587/how-i-name-my-apps">this article</a> on naming apps, I came up with what I thought was a marvelous idea. I had been looking around for ideas to work on and this was just perfect- a web application that suggests names for apps based on keywords. Since my thoughts and ideas on the application was based only on the above-mentioned article, I merely assumed that nobody else had already created such a website. </p>
<p>After some moments of dreamy satisfaction at my new idea, I started to plan how to actually build it. My first thought of course was to use an existing library or an API that would find words related to the keywords provided by the user. I knew there were APIs for a thesaurus, so I Googled it and found two that seemed to be popular- <a href="http://words.bighugelabs.com/api.php">Big Huge Thesaurus</a> and <a href="http://developer.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>. I opened both the sites, Wordnik's developer site seemed somewhat more attractive so, I checked that one out first. I could see from that page that quite popular sites and softwares like Facebook, Google Chrome, Firefox, Android had used the Wordnik API too, so I was pretty impressed. </p>
<p>I wanted to see example usage of the API, just to get a better picture of how I'd write the app soI clicked on the 'Showcase' hoping I'd find what I was looking for. The 'Showcase' page, as it turns out would dissapoint me, not only because it didn't have what I was looking for but because I found out the moment the page loaded that I wasn't the first to conceive the idea I had. The app, called <a href="http://panabee.com/">Panabee</a> was listed at the very top. </p>
<p>Naturally, I was very dissapointed by the revelation. I checked out the site and I have to say, I found myself impressed(...by an app that,some moments ago, I was hoping to build). So that was it,I was right where I started- again on the lookout for a new web app idea(this time hopeful that it hasn't already been built).  <br />

	<h2><a href="http://samrat.me/blog/2011/08/innovating-in-a-developing-nation" title="Permalink to Innovating in a developing nation">Innovating in a developing nation</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p>Innovation is really hard to find in a developing nation. Innovation requires taking risks because when you’re innovating you are, by definition, doing things in a way that is unconventional. And taking risks in a developing nation is hard. Firstly because in a developing country the people’s first priority is to achieve financial security. Thus, many end up getting a safe job with a large corporation than risking their money by starting an enterprise. However, although that may lead to a secure future, it definitely doesn’t lead to prosperity, both for the individual and the nation. </p>
<p>So, how can a developing nation cultivate a culture of innovation? Now, I know that a lot of people will say that the government should improve its policies to become more entrepreneur-friendly. Yes, in most developing nations governmental policies and governments can become huge setbacks to entrepreneurship; in fact, that’s probably the reason why they are developing nations in the first place. But what we must realize is that governmental policies are unlikely to change anytime soon. So whatever can be done has to be from our side. </p>
<p>The answer, in my opinion, to improve the startup scene in any nation is to <em>start small</em>. Entrepreneurs and innovators need to learn how to start small and make the best of the resources they have available. This is actually quite easy for web startups these days, as so much software is available for free online. Also, services like Amazon EC2 make it extremely cheap to create websites that can scale in response to the popularity it gains. </p>
<p><em>Bootstrapping</em> is a word that has caught on a lot recently, and not without good reason. Traditionally, the way to start a business was to raise a lot of capital and then start making and selling your stuff. Bootstrapping, on the other hand, means starting with very little cash and then turning those small investments into a profit. That’s the way a lot of today’s big companies like Apple, Google and Facebook did it. (Of course, they all raised money later from investors so that they could grow even larger.) </p>
<p>However, the most important part of innovating or starting a business is <em>solving problems</em>- actual problems. A lot of web startups these days solve what have properly been coined the name first world problems and they aren’t really problems, at least not compared to the third world problems. Now, if you want your creation to survive in a poor developing nation, then your creation better be good. One good example of a company solving an actual problem is <a href="http://harilo.com" title="Harilo">Harilo</a>. People in Nepal can’t order from stores like Amazon.com so the guys at Harilo created a service which allowed them to. It may not be a totally new idea(I’ve seen another Indian website offering a similar service) but its opened up a whole new world of online shopping in Nepal. </p>
<p>Innovation is something citizens of developing nations must indulge in- it’s the only way we’ll be able to move forward. We are already part of the wonderful world the Internet has made possible and now is the best time to join the league of people whose beautiful creations shape this world. </p>

	<h2><a href="http://samrat.me/blog/2011/08/newsblur-an-awesome-alternative-to-google-reader" title="Permalink to Newsblur, an awesome alternative to Google Reader">Newsblur, an awesome alternative to Google Reader</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p>I've recently <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2805152">discovered</a> a new web app called <a href="http://newsblur.com">Newsblur</a>. Basically, Newsblur is a feed reader and aims to solve many problems Google Reader doesn't. Newsblur gives you the option of viewing the original website page along with the feed, so you can browse through the feed to see if anything interests you and then, see the actual webpage inside Newsblur itself. </p>
<p>Newsblur also has this cool little feature called Intelligence Trainer. What you can do with it is that you can train Newsblur, to find articles from your subscriptions that are potentially interesting to you.  You can train the Newsblur Intelligence by 'liking' a tag or an author or other pieces of metadata. And by doing so, you'll help Newsblur identify similar items that could be interesting to you. More importantly, it helps you discard items which you wouldn't want to read.</p>
<p>You can join Newsblur for free, however the free account has a limit of 64 subscriptions; you can also get a paid Premium account. I have used a free account for a while and my experience with it so far has been pretty fine. Its much faster than Google Reader and with its features, it helps me reach the <em>important content</em> faster. However, it is a work in progress and thus some features like organizing feeds into folders, sending articles to Instapaper still need polishing.</p>
<p>Newsblur is an <a href="http://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/">opensource project</a> by Samuel Clay(<a href="http://twitter.com/samuelclay">@samuelclay</a>). Check it out, if you use Google Reader, you'll probably like it. </p>
