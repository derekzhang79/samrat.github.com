	<p>If you've been following the tech world recently you'd know that Apple and Google haven't been the best of friends lately. You know, because Google ripped off Apple the same way Microsoft had ripped them off back when the PC boom was kicking off. There's a statement by Steve Jobs in his biography which can only be regarded as a declaration of war on Google. And we are starting to actually see this war taking place- a few weeks ago, Apple declared that the new iOS will come with its own 'Google Maps'-like service instead of Google Maps.</p>
<p>And now, Google too has announced its answer to what was iOS 5's most famous addition- Siri. It's not exactly like Siri- in fact, Google has tried to go a step further and make a more smarter system. If Google succeeds in rolling out Project Glass then Google Now will be a pretty nifty feature for it too. Watch the video below to find out what Now is all about:</p>

	<p>I found this totally neat infograph today on <a href="http://www.visualnews.com/2012/06/19/how-much-data-created-every-minute/?view=infographic">Visual News</a> and thought I'd share it with you guys. </p>

<p>Now, for a shameless plug: you might want to check out a web app I made a few weeks ago that helps you put into context how fast video is being added to Youtube- <a href="http://omgyoutube.herokuapp.com/">OMGYoutube</a>.</p>

	<h2><a href="blog/2012/05/would-you-want-to-be-on-svbtle.html" title="Permalink to Would you want to be on Svbtle?">Would you want to be on Svbtle?</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p>When I first saw the Hacker News <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3742314">post</a> about <a href="http://svbtle.com/">Svbtle</a>, I opened it. Svbtle looked interesting, maybe something I'd want to use but then came the part about it being only for a small number of "vetted bloggers" and like so many others I was dissapointed. The design looked so good, it was a shame I couldn't use it. </p>
<p>Soon, <em>the debate</em> had already started. As I said, I wasn't the only one dissapointed that it was a closed system- everyone seemed to be complaining, but <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3744237">someone else</a> had gone a step ahead and built something similar called <a href="http://natewienert.com/codename-obtvse">Obtvse</a> and released its code. Svbtle became the <strong>hot story</strong> on Hacker News; even TechCrunch ran a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/24/forget-todays-drama-dustin-curtis-svbtle-is-trying-to-push-blogging-forward/">piece on it</a>. </p>
<p>So, how has things changed since I first read Dustin Curtis' post about Suvbtle? Well, now I don't really want to be on it. It's just gotten too much publicity and now the guys who are already in, the <em>vetted bloggers</em> who were <em>witty and intelligent</em> enough to get invited, kind of look like the bad guys. Regardless of how awesome the design is(yeah, I still the think the design is really neat), right now I think having the Svbtle brand name on my site is not something I'd want.</p>
<p>What do you guys think? Would you want to be on Svbtle?</p>
