	<p>I have been wanting to create a serious web app for some time now, and I think I just did. Well, to be more accurate its a pretty simple web service. Let me introduce to you <a href="http://instamator.ep.io">Instamator</a>, it lets you easily grab and use the photos you've liked on Instagram, the popular photo-sharing app(for iOS devices only- but you can check <a href="http://inkstagram.com/">Inkstagram</a> for a web interface). </p>
<p>How does it do that? It produces feeds(JSON, RSS and text) about the photos you liked on Instagram which you can use to easily download all your Instagram "likes" or integrate on your website or blog. </p>
<p>Instamator was inpired by <a href="http://flickmator.heroku.com">Flickmator</a>, a similar web service built by <a href="http://thomas.pelletier.im">Thomas Pelletier</a>. It is powered by <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a>, <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> and hosted on <a href="http://ep.io">ep.io</a>.</p>

	<h2><a href="blog/2011/08/newsblur-an-awesome-alternative-to-google-reader" title="Permalink to Newsblur, an awesome alternative to Google Reader">Newsblur, an awesome alternative to Google Reader</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p>I've recently <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2805152">discovered</a> a new web app called <a href="http://newsblur.com">Newsblur</a>. Basically, Newsblur is a feed reader and aims to solve many problems Google Reader doesn't. Newsblur gives you the option of viewing the original website page along with the feed, so you can browse through the feed to see if anything interests you and then, see the actual webpage inside Newsblur itself. </p>
<p>Newsblur also has this cool little feature called Intelligence Trainer. What you can do with it is that you can train Newsblur, to find articles from your subscriptions that are potentially interesting to you.  You can train the Newsblur Intelligence by 'liking' a tag or an author or other pieces of metadata. And by doing so, you'll help Newsblur identify similar items that could be interesting to you. More importantly, it helps you discard items which you wouldn't want to read.</p>
<p>You can join Newsblur for free, however the free account has a limit of 64 subscriptions; you can also get a paid Premium account. I have used a free account for a while and my experience with it so far has been pretty fine. Its much faster than Google Reader and with its features, it helps me reach the <em>important content</em> faster. However, it is a work in progress and thus some features like organizing feeds into folders, sending articles to Instapaper still need polishing.</p>
<p>Newsblur is an <a href="http://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/">opensource project</a> by Samuel Clay(<a href="http://twitter.com/samuelclay">@samuelclay</a>). Check it out, if you use Google Reader, you'll probably like it. </p>

	<h2><a href="blog/2011/10/the-gamification-of-games" title="Permalink to The Gamification of Games">The Gamification of Games</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p>On the front page of Hacker News I saw an item today: <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3114239"><em>Who killed videogames? How games are getting more addictive but not fun</em></a>. And frankly, I haven’t even read the “ghost story” yet. Still, I think I get from the elaborated title what the article is going to say. I’d also recently read <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/10/the-gamification.html">The Gamification</a> on Coding Horror (which is actually not quite related to the context) and I couldn’t help make an association here between, and this is going to sound weird, games and gamification.</p>
<p>Over the last one or two years games like Farmville, Angry Birds, Doodle Jump suddenly started getting a lot of attention. Those games got downloaded or played by millions of people. Obviously, a huge part of their success is due to the successful platforms they were built for, but the reason so many people have become hooked on to these games is actually how they are built to be addictive. The developers of these have put visibly much more focus on the addictiveness of the game, than say Age of Empires or Counter Strike. Of course, I do not mean to imply that those games aren’t fun or addictive. The thing is, gamers would fall in love with these games. But no one really “loves” Farmville  they just become obsessed with it. And while, games like Angry Birds are mighty time-killers they just don’t arouse the enthusiasm games like Call of Duty did. </p>
<p>So why is there such a drastic change in how games are built? The answer: Money. Before, the way game developers made money was by selling the game on a CD or DVD. Today the game itself is available for free, but game companies have figured out newer, more valuable ways to mine money out of these games. And the way they made money, required the players to be very involved in those games. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zynga">Zynga</a>, the company behind Farmville makes money by selling virtual goods in the game(Zynga's business model is explained in much detail <a href="http://www.financemanila.net/2011/02/how-does-zynga-make-money-their-business-model-and-revenues/">here</a>). This is the same business model that carrier companies like AT&amp;T use these days. They give you shiny smartphones at low prices and then mine money off you from your data usage. </p>
<p>What all this means is that game companies have an incentive to get you addicted to the game, whatever it takes. And they are doing it really well. According to Wikipedia, “As of July 2011, Zynga's games on Facebook have over 232 million monthly active users.” and it’s valued at $15 billion to $20 billion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rovio">Rovio(Angry Birds)</a> whose business model has been speculated <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/22420/how-does-rovio-angry-birds-make-money/22434#22434">in this OnStartups answer</a> also has had really high profits. </p>
<p>What these companies have done, for good or for bad, is figured out how to successfully make a lot of money in the gaming industry. And the way they did it was by gamifying games. </p>

	<h2><a href="blog/2012/03/the-internet-first-impressions" title="Permalink to The Internet- First Impressions">The Internet- First Impressions</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p>True, the Internet has changed the way we do business, the way we access information and the way we communicate. It is a revolutionary tool, which has probably already secured a place in the history books of the future. Lately, however, the way we use the Internet has changed too. My earliest memories of the Internet is how I used to throw questions at the butler from AskJeeves.com. For those unfamiliar with it, AskJeeves(which is now Ask.com). was a search engine similar to Google.</p>
<p>That was my introduction to the Internet: it was a butler who would try to satisfy my curiosities. However as I see it, things are changing. If I were to guess, I’d say that most people who start using the Internet these days start from social networking sites like Facebook. Now, I’ve got nothing against Facebook or social networking tools but I just don’t think that a person’s first impression of the Internet should be that it was built to emulate real-world society. Nor should kids be limited to a walled site that gives them a very limited perspective of the Internet. The internet is so much more than that. It’s so much more than what, in my opinion, most people perceive it to be. And I believe that everyone should know and make use of the endless opportunities it creates.</p>
<p>The way people are being introduced to the internet may also be damaging to the whole ethos of the internet itself. For instance, someone with the impression that the purpose for building the Internet was to network socially will probably never make a significant contribution to the knowledge base of the internet. Furthermore, I think that these are the people who go around making stupid comments which don’t add any value to the conversation.</p>
<p>The number of internet users is growing rapidly but do we want these people to stay limited to the walled gardens of Facebook or so many other sites which are pretty fun to hang out but limit its users off what is a gigantuan amount of knowledge? I think that we really need to rethink the way that we are introducing people to the internet. That is absolutely necessary if we are to keep the resourcefulness of the internet sustainable.</p>
