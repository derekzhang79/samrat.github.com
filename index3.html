	<p><a href="http://videodropper.ep.io"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/25029287/2011-10-16-151433_1280x800_scrot.png" style="width:500px; height:300px; float:left; padding:10px;"/></a></p>
<p>If you're constantly troubled by having to wait for Youtube to buffer videos, or want to keep some videos with you so you can watch them again and again without wasting bandwidth, then I've just recently released a web service that lets you download videos from Youtube. <strong>But there are plenty of websites that already do that, why do I need another one?</strong>. <em>What <a href="http://videodropper.ep.io">Videodropper</a>(yeah, that's what its called) actually does is it sends videos to your Dropbox folder</em>.<br />
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Why send it to Dropbox?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Syncing</strong>- Instead of downloading the video to your computer you'll be saving it to your personal cloud which will be accessible to you on any PC or mobile device. So sending a Youtube video to your Dropbox folder is basically the same as downloading into your machine, only more awesome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bandwidth</strong>- Bandwidth <em>is</em> the primary motivation for why I built Videodropper. I have a rather slow internet connection and I get all sort of problems when watching Youtube videos- having to wait for buffering, videos getting stuck(it always happens to me when I resize the player), and the list goes on. Videodropper solves these problems because <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/help/26"><strong>"Dropbox is smart about using bandwidth."</strong></a> Downloading happens at the fastest possible speed, but without interfering with your Internet usage, so if you have a slow connection you'll be able to download Youtube videos and still use the Internet at optimal speed. Also, once its fully downloaded <strong>you can watch the full video without any pain</strong>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>iOS devices</strong>- Dropbox works great on iOS devices and you can optimize videos you send using Videodropper to work on the iPhone or iPod touch. After you've synced the videos, you can also watch them later offline(this makes use of Dropbox's Local Storage on your iPhone/iPod).
<br/><br/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do I use Videodropper?</h2>
<p>Using Videodropper is really easy. After linking Videodropper with your Dropbox account, you just copy the URL of the video you want to send, paste it into Videodropper and then send it. A bookmarklet is also being worked on in order to further simplify this process. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that Videodropper is still in Beta, so some of your videos may not get through properly, in case you notice any thing strange kindly send an email to samratmansingh@gmail.com or reach me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/samratmansingh">@samratmansingh</a></p>

	</hgroup>
	<p>I just read this short but really thoughtful <a href="http://sahillavingia.com/blog/why-im-scared-of-the-post-pc-era/">blog post</a> by <a href="http://sahillavingia.com/">Sahil Lavingia</a> and couldn't agree with it more. A lot of the products we use today are products of the <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">hacker mindset</a>- the personal computer, Facebook, Google. All these are here today because some guy or guys didn't just sit around waiting for some big company to make something they wanted but instead, went ahead and built what they had needed. In fact, they built it even when there were big companies building such things, just because they knew they could build a better product than those that already existed. And they built those things, despite the fact that they didn't have even a small fraction of the resources the large corporations had. And then, they built it and eventually even outgrew those very corporations. Yahoo Mail now has a <em>Sign in with Google</em> option!</p>
<p>Things like LEGO blocks teach us that we can go beyond being users to become builders. However, as more people "start their technology career with iPads" and their Internet careers with Facebook, the tech industry might lose the enthusiastic innovation and curiosity it is now filled with. </p>
<p>"But hopefully I am wrong." Well, I really hope he is.<br />

	<h2><a href="http://samrat.me/blog/2011/10/the-gamification-of-games" title="Permalink to The Gamification of Games">The Gamification of Games</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p>On the front page of Hacker News I saw an item today: <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3114239"><em>Who killed videogames? How games are getting more addictive but not fun</em></a>. And frankly, I haven’t even read the “ghost story” yet. Still, I think I get from the elaborated title what the article is going to say. I’d also recently read <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/10/the-gamification.html">The Gamification</a> on Coding Horror (which is actually not quite related to the context) and I couldn’t help make an association here between, and this is going to sound weird, games and gamification.</p>
<p>Over the last one or two years games like Farmville, Angry Birds, Doodle Jump suddenly started getting a lot of attention. Those games got downloaded or played by millions of people. Obviously, a huge part of their success is due to the successful platforms they were built for, but the reason so many people have become hooked on to these games is actually how they are built to be addictive. The developers of these have put visibly much more focus on the addictiveness of the game, than say Age of Empires or Counter Strike. Of course, I do not mean to imply that those games aren’t fun or addictive. The thing is, gamers would fall in love with these games. But no one really “loves” Farmville  they just become obsessed with it. And while, games like Angry Birds are mighty time-killers they just don’t arouse the enthusiasm games like Call of Duty did. </p>
<p>So why is there such a drastic change in how games are built? The answer: Money. Before, the way game developers made money was by selling the game on a CD or DVD. Today the game itself is available for free, but game companies have figured out newer, more valuable ways to mine money out of these games. And the way they made money, required the players to be very involved in those games. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zynga">Zynga</a>, the company behind Farmville makes money by selling virtual goods in the game(Zynga's business model is explained in much detail <a href="http://www.financemanila.net/2011/02/how-does-zynga-make-money-their-business-model-and-revenues/">here</a>). This is the same business model that carrier companies like AT&amp;T use these days. They give you shiny smartphones at low prices and then mine money off you from your data usage. </p>
<p>What all this means is that game companies have an incentive to get you addicted to the game, whatever it takes. And they are doing it really well. According to Wikipedia, “As of July 2011, Zynga's games on Facebook have over 232 million monthly active users.” and it’s valued at $15 billion to $20 billion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rovio">Rovio(Angry Birds)</a> whose business model has been speculated <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/22420/how-does-rovio-angry-birds-make-money/22434#22434">in this OnStartups answer</a> also has had really high profits. </p>
<p>What these companies have done, for good or for bad, is figured out how to successfully make a lot of money in the gaming industry. And the way they did it was by gamifying games. </p>

	<p>I have been wanting to create a serious web app for some time now, and I think I just did. Well, to be more accurate its a pretty simple web service. Let me introduce to you <a href="http://instamator.ep.io">Instamator</a>, it lets you easily grab and use the photos you've liked on Instagram, the popular photo-sharing app(for iOS devices only- but you can check <a href="http://inkstagram.com/">Inkstagram</a> for a web interface). </p>
<p>How does it do that? It produces feeds(JSON, RSS and text) about the photos you liked on Instagram which you can use to easily download all your Instagram "likes" or integrate on your website or blog. </p>
<p>Instamator was inpired by <a href="http://flickmator.heroku.com">Flickmator</a>, a similar web service built by <a href="http://thomas.pelletier.im">Thomas Pelletier</a>. It is powered by <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a>, <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> and hosted on <a href="http://ep.io">ep.io</a>.</p>
