<p>It had taken a few weeks, but it had still been much easier than Nick had anticipated. For a while Nick wondered why no one had tried it before and whether his idea, which was now already a working computer program, was really a smart idea. But he waved off his suspicions. He told himself that this would work out, that all the effort he had been putting in every evening after work would not go to waste.</p>
<p>Nick ran the program once again. A few seconds passed, then the dark terminal window was filled with words from the English dictionary. Cautiously, Nick started reading from an arbitrary paragraph in the terminal- he still wasn't sure whether the program would suceed each time. As he started his third sentence, he let out a pleasant sigh and he smiled at the computer screen. The sentences were not only semantically correct, they were actually something that one might call interesting. And they were composed by the program Nick had created. Technically, the program probably wasn't such a big feat. Computers had been able to compose melodious music; his program would probably appeal less to computer scientists than Siri. But Nick had never been and academic and he certainly had no intentions of showing off his program to scientists.</p>
<p>If everything worked out as planned, his creation would, at the least, some security to quit his job.<br />
