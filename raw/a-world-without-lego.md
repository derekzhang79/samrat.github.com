I just read this short but really thoughtful [blog post][1] by [Sahil Lavingia][2] and couldn't agree with it more. A lot of the products we use today are products of the [hacker mindset][3]- the personal computer, Facebook, Google. All these are here today because some guy or guys didn't just sit around waiting for some big company to make something they wanted but instead, went ahead and built what they had needed. In fact, they built it even when there were big companies building such things, just because they knew they could build a better product than those that already existed. And they built those things, despite the fact that they didn't have even a small fraction of the resources the large corporations had. And then, they built it and eventually even outgrew those very corporations. Yahoo Mail now has a *Sign in with Google* option!

Things like LEGO blocks teach us that we can go beyond being users to become builders. However, as more people "start their technology career with iPads" and their Internet careers with Facebook, the tech industry might lose the enthusiastic innovation and curiosity it is now filled with. 

"But hopefully I am wrong." Well, I really hope he is.
