Not unlike **to-do lists**, reading lists(or rather *read-later* lists) always seem to grow at a way greater pace than a person can check-off its items. That's one of the reasons why I made [Reading Packet][rp], a small web app that uses the [Pocket][pocket] API to help you find articles depending on how much time you've got.

If you haven't started using a *read-later* app, [Pocket][pocket] is really great, and free! And once you've added a few items, you can start reading with Reading Packet whenever you're free.

[Give it a try!][rp] and don't forget to tell me what you think.
