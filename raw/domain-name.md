Title: Help me buy a domain name

I've got a problem. I want to buy a domain name for this website. But due to some banking regulations in my country, online payments cannot be made(for international transactions, at least.) Some companies *are* making money by buying products on Amazon and other online shops on behalf of people here, but they're limited to only physical goods. 

This problem has been troubling me for a while, and I've come up with what could be a solution. Following all the recent buzz around Kickstarter- I decided to ask the Internet for help, but don't worry, **I'm not asking for your money**. 

If you're still reading this and interested in helping *and if you happen to be a person who is about to buy a domain name*, you can support my cause by buying a domain name with my [affiliate link][aff] on Namecheap. That way, a small percentage of what you spend on Namecheap might help me get a domain name for myself. But if you're not interested, no pressure, I can live without a domain name; just please don't take this the wrong way.

If you're interested in helping but not looking to register a domain name right now, you could bookmark the link above and use that to make your purchase later. As you can probably tell, I haven't used Namecheap but I've heard they're great!

Thank you :)
