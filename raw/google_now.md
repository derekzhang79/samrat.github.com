If you've been following the tech world recently you'd know that Apple and Google haven't been the best of friends lately. You know, because Google ripped off Apple the same way Microsoft had ripped them off back when the PC boom was kicking off. There's a statement by Steve Jobs in his biography which can only be regarded as a declaration of war on Google. And we are starting to actually see this war taking place- a few weeks ago, Apple declared that the new iOS will come with its own 'Google Maps'-like service instead of Google Maps.

And now, Google too has announced its answer to what was iOS 5's most famous addition- Siri. It's not exactly like Siri- in fact, Google has tried to go a step further and make a more smarter system. If Google succeeds in rolling out Project Glass then Google Now will be a pretty nifty feature for it too. Watch the video below to find out what Now is all about:
