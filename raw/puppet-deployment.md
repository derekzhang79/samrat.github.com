Title: A first look at provisioning with Puppet(on a Vagrant box)

In my [previous post][prev_post], I talked about deploying a Flask app on a Vagrant box using Gunicorn and Nginx. The response I got was mind-blowing, so I've decided to write about another neat tool that's awesome for deploying web apps- Puppet. [Vagrant][vagrant] actually encourages its users to use it, and you should use it. **There's also an alternative to Puppet called [Chef][chef]; some people prefer that over Puppet, so you might want to check it out.**

Hopefully I'll be able to demonstrate what Puppet does and why its awesome in this post. But please note that this isn't meant as a comprehensive tutorial, you should check out Puppet's [docs][puppet] for that. Also even though the Puppet docs asks you to get the Learning Puppet VM, I found it much more comfortable to use `vagrant ssh` for learning Puppet, so if you already have Vagraant installed, you might want to try that out too- just try running `puppet` inside the virtual machine. 

What Puppet does is something called *provisioning*- that means that it *[makes computers do what they are supposed to do][scobleizer_puppet]*. In other words, it does the configuring for you. To understand what that means, let's see it in action.

First create a Vagrant box, 

	::shell
	mkdir codebase_with_puppet
	cd codebase_with_puppet

	vagrant init

You should now see Vagrantfile. Open it with a text editor, then uncomment the lines

	::puppet
	config.vm.provision :puppet do |puppet|
		puppet.manifests_path = "manifests"
		puppet.manifest_file  = "base.pp"
	end

Now, create `base.pp` inside a folder called manifests, and add the following to it.

	::puppet
	package {"nginx":
		ensure => present,
	}

Now, run `vagrant up`. You'll notice that Vagrant automatically installs `nginx` after it boots the VM. You should get a message like 

	::shell
	notice: /Stage[main]//Package[nginx]/ensure: ensure changed 'purged' to 'present'

This can become a real treasure as this way, you won't have to memorize what you need to install, to get the app running. All the system needs is to have `puppet` installed, after that `puppet` with the right manifests will handle everything. 

Now, let's do something different with Puppet- instead of installing another package, we'll use it to configure `nginx`. 

First, create a file in your local machine, inside `codebase_with_puppet` called `codebase_nginx`. To that file add the following

	::nginx
	server {
		location / {
			proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
		}
	}

If you've gone through the [previous post][prev_post] you'll notice that it's the same configuration that we had used. 

Now, we'll use Puppet to make sure that the configuration file is placed where its supposed to be. To your `base.pp` file, add 

	::puppet 
	file {"rm-nginx-default":
		path => '/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default',
		ensure => absent,
		require => Package['nginx'],
	}

	file {"setup-nginx-codebase":
		path => '/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/codebase_nginx',
		ensure => present,
		require => Package['nginx'],
		source => "/vagrant/codebase_nginx",
	}

Run `vagrant reload` and you're done with the `nginx` configuration. Besides removing the repetitiveness for you, Puppet is also wonderful when you're working on a team or on an open-source project. Now, all you need to do is write the manifests and once you share them you can rest assured that the entire team has the exact same environment.
