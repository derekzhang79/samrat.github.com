When I first saw the Hacker News [post][hn] about [Svbtle][svbtle], I opened it. Svbtle looked interesting, maybe something I'd want to use but then came the part about it being only for a small number of "vetted bloggers" and like so many others I was dissapointed. The design looked so good, it was a shame I couldn't use it. 

Soon, *the debate* had already started. As I said, I wasn't the only one dissapointed that it was a closed system- everyone seemed to be complaining, but [someone else][hn_obtvse] had gone a step ahead and built something similar called [Obtvse][obtvse] and released its code. Svbtle became the **hot story** on Hacker News; even TechCrunch ran a [piece on it][techcrunch]. 

So, how has things changed since I first read Dustin Curtis' post about Suvbtle? Well, now I don't really want to be on it. It's just gotten too much publicity and now the guys who are already in, the *vetted bloggers* who were *witty and intelligent* enough to get invited, kind of look like the bad guys. Regardless of how awesome the design is(yeah, I still the think the design is really neat), right now I think having the Svbtle brand name on my site is not something I'd want.

What do you guys think? Would you want to be on Svbtle?
