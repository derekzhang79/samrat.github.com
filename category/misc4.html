	<h2><a href="blog/2011/10/the-gamification-of-games" title="Permalink to The Gamification of Games">The Gamification of Games</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p>On the front page of Hacker News I saw an item today: <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3114239"><em>Who killed videogames? How games are getting more addictive but not fun</em></a>. And frankly, I haven’t even read the “ghost story” yet. Still, I think I get from the elaborated title what the article is going to say. I’d also recently read <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/10/the-gamification.html">The Gamification</a> on Coding Horror (which is actually not quite related to the context) and I couldn’t help make an association here between, and this is going to sound weird, games and gamification.</p>
<p>Over the last one or two years games like Farmville, Angry Birds, Doodle Jump suddenly started getting a lot of attention. Those games got downloaded or played by millions of people. Obviously, a huge part of their success is due to the successful platforms they were built for, but the reason so many people have become hooked on to these games is actually how they are built to be addictive. The developers of these have put visibly much more focus on the addictiveness of the game, than say Age of Empires or Counter Strike. Of course, I do not mean to imply that those games aren’t fun or addictive. The thing is, gamers would fall in love with these games. But no one really “loves” Farmville  they just become obsessed with it. And while, games like Angry Birds are mighty time-killers they just don’t arouse the enthusiasm games like Call of Duty did. </p>
<p>So why is there such a drastic change in how games are built? The answer: Money. Before, the way game developers made money was by selling the game on a CD or DVD. Today the game itself is available for free, but game companies have figured out newer, more valuable ways to mine money out of these games. And the way they made money, required the players to be very involved in those games. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zynga">Zynga</a>, the company behind Farmville makes money by selling virtual goods in the game(Zynga's business model is explained in much detail <a href="http://www.financemanila.net/2011/02/how-does-zynga-make-money-their-business-model-and-revenues/">here</a>). This is the same business model that carrier companies like AT&amp;T use these days. They give you shiny smartphones at low prices and then mine money off you from your data usage. </p>
<p>What all this means is that game companies have an incentive to get you addicted to the game, whatever it takes. And they are doing it really well. According to Wikipedia, “As of July 2011, Zynga's games on Facebook have over 232 million monthly active users.” and it’s valued at $15 billion to $20 billion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rovio">Rovio(Angry Birds)</a> whose business model has been speculated <a href="http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/22420/how-does-rovio-angry-birds-make-money/22434#22434">in this OnStartups answer</a> also has had really high profits. </p>
<p>What these companies have done, for good or for bad, is figured out how to successfully make a lot of money in the gaming industry. And the way they did it was by gamifying games. </p>

	<p>I have been wanting to create a serious web app for some time now, and I think I just did. Well, to be more accurate its a pretty simple web service. Let me introduce to you <a href="http://instamator.ep.io">Instamator</a>, it lets you easily grab and use the photos you've liked on Instagram, the popular photo-sharing app(for iOS devices only- but you can check <a href="http://inkstagram.com/">Inkstagram</a> for a web interface). </p>
<p>How does it do that? It produces feeds(JSON, RSS and text) about the photos you liked on Instagram which you can use to easily download all your Instagram "likes" or integrate on your website or blog. </p>
<p>Instamator was inpired by <a href="http://flickmator.heroku.com">Flickmator</a>, a similar web service built by <a href="http://thomas.pelletier.im">Thomas Pelletier</a>. It is powered by <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a>, <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> and hosted on <a href="http://ep.io">ep.io</a>.</p>

	<h2><a href="blog/2011/09/theres-already-a-website-for-that" title="Permalink to There's already a website for that">There's already a website for that</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p>After reading <a href="http://blog.zachwaugh.com/post/9666969587/how-i-name-my-apps">this article</a> on naming apps, I came up with what I thought was a marvelous idea. I had been looking around for ideas to work on and this was just perfect- a web application that suggests names for apps based on keywords. Since my thoughts and ideas on the application was based only on the above-mentioned article, I merely assumed that nobody else had already created such a website. </p>
<p>After some moments of dreamy satisfaction at my new idea, I started to plan how to actually build it. My first thought of course was to use an existing library or an API that would find words related to the keywords provided by the user. I knew there were APIs for a thesaurus, so I Googled it and found two that seemed to be popular- <a href="http://words.bighugelabs.com/api.php">Big Huge Thesaurus</a> and <a href="http://developer.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>. I opened both the sites, Wordnik's developer site seemed somewhat more attractive so, I checked that one out first. I could see from that page that quite popular sites and softwares like Facebook, Google Chrome, Firefox, Android had used the Wordnik API too, so I was pretty impressed. </p>
<p>I wanted to see example usage of the API, just to get a better picture of how I'd write the app soI clicked on the 'Showcase' hoping I'd find what I was looking for. The 'Showcase' page, as it turns out would dissapoint me, not only because it didn't have what I was looking for but because I found out the moment the page loaded that I wasn't the first to conceive the idea I had. The app, called <a href="http://panabee.com/">Panabee</a> was listed at the very top. </p>
<p>Naturally, I was very dissapointed by the revelation. I checked out the site and I have to say, I found myself impressed(...by an app that,some moments ago, I was hoping to build). So that was it,I was right where I started- again on the lookout for a new web app idea(this time hopeful that it hasn't already been built).  <br />

	<h2><a href="blog/2011/08/innovating-in-a-developing-nation" title="Permalink to Innovating in a developing nation">Innovating in a developing nation</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p>Innovation is really hard to find in a developing nation. Innovation requires taking risks because when you’re innovating you are, by definition, doing things in a way that is unconventional. And taking risks in a developing nation is hard. Firstly because in a developing country the people’s first priority is to achieve financial security. Thus, many end up getting a safe job with a large corporation than risking their money by starting an enterprise. However, although that may lead to a secure future, it definitely doesn’t lead to prosperity, both for the individual and the nation. </p>
<p>So, how can a developing nation cultivate a culture of innovation? Now, I know that a lot of people will say that the government should improve its policies to become more entrepreneur-friendly. Yes, in most developing nations governmental policies and governments can become huge setbacks to entrepreneurship; in fact, that’s probably the reason why they are developing nations in the first place. But what we must realize is that governmental policies are unlikely to change anytime soon. So whatever can be done has to be from our side. </p>
<p>The answer, in my opinion, to improve the startup scene in any nation is to <em>start small</em>. Entrepreneurs and innovators need to learn how to start small and make the best of the resources they have available. This is actually quite easy for web startups these days, as so much software is available for free online. Also, services like Amazon EC2 make it extremely cheap to create websites that can scale in response to the popularity it gains. </p>
<p><em>Bootstrapping</em> is a word that has caught on a lot recently, and not without good reason. Traditionally, the way to start a business was to raise a lot of capital and then start making and selling your stuff. Bootstrapping, on the other hand, means starting with very little cash and then turning those small investments into a profit. That’s the way a lot of today’s big companies like Apple, Google and Facebook did it. (Of course, they all raised money later from investors so that they could grow even larger.) </p>
<p>However, the most important part of innovating or starting a business is <em>solving problems</em>- actual problems. A lot of web startups these days solve what have properly been coined the name first world problems and they aren’t really problems, at least not compared to the third world problems. Now, if you want your creation to survive in a poor developing nation, then your creation better be good. One good example of a company solving an actual problem is <a href="http://harilo.com" title="Harilo">Harilo</a>. People in Nepal can’t order from stores like Amazon.com so the guys at Harilo created a service which allowed them to. It may not be a totally new idea(I’ve seen another Indian website offering a similar service) but its opened up a whole new world of online shopping in Nepal. </p>
<p>Innovation is something citizens of developing nations must indulge in- it’s the only way we’ll be able to move forward. We are already part of the wonderful world the Internet has made possible and now is the best time to join the league of people whose beautiful creations shape this world. </p>
