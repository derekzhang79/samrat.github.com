	</hgroup>
	<p>Not unlike <strong>to-do lists</strong>, reading lists(or rather <em>read-later</em> lists) always seem to grow at a way greater pace than a person can check-off its items. That's one of the reasons why I made <a href="http://reading-packet.samrat.me">Reading Packet</a>, a small web app that uses the <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> API to help you find articles depending on how much time you've got.</p>
<p>If you haven't started using a <em>read-later</em> app, <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> is really great, and free! And once you've added a few items, you can start reading with Reading Packet whenever you're free.</p>
<p><a href="http://reading-packet.samrat.me">Give it a try!</a> and don't forget to tell me what you think.</p>

	<h2><a href="blog/2012/08/how-to-add-reading-time-to-your-website-or-blog" title="Permalink to How to add Reading Time to your website or blog">How to add Reading Time to your website or blog</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p>A few days ago I released <a href="http://reading-time.samrat.me">Reading Time</a>, a small Noir web app that tells you how long it will take for you to read an online article. The front-facing web app is pretty simple to use- just copy the URL of an article, paste it into Reading Time and it'll tell you how long you'll probably need to read the article. </p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/IITRk"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IITRk.png?1" title="Reading Time" alt="" width='675px'/></a></p>
<p>So, instead I'm going to go through how to embed Reading Time into your blog or website, so you can tell your readers how long they will take to read an article. The original inspiration for Reading Time was <a href="http://swizec.com">Swizec</a>'s blog post- <a href="http://swizec.com/blog/services-i-want-to-pay-for/swizec/5158">Services I want to pay for</a> which lists the idea as <strong>"Tell my users how long they are likely to take reading a story"</strong> so I had been working on an API along with the web app right from the beginning. </p>
<h2>The API</h2>
<p>The API is dead simple. Send a GET request to <code>http://reading-time.samrat.me/api</code> with just <code>url</code> as a parameter and you'll get a JSON message. If JSONP is required, send a <code>callback</code> argument too.</p>
<p>The URL should look like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">http</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">reading</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">time</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">samrat</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">me</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">api</span>?<span class="n">url</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">http</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">samrat</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">me</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">/</span>2011<span class="o">/</span>08<span class="o">/</span><span class="n">newsblur</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">an</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">awesome</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">alternative</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">to</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">google</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">reader</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">callback</span><span class="p">=</span>?
</pre></div>


<p>This is what the responses look like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>curl http://reading-time.samrat.me/api?url<span class="o">=</span>http://samrat.me/blog/2011/08/newsblur-an-awesome-alternative-to-google-reader&amp;callback<span class="o">=</span>?
?<span class="o">({</span><span class="s2">&quot;minutes&quot;</span>:1.0160000324249268,<span class="s2">&quot;readable&quot;</span>:<span class="s2">&quot;1 minutes, 0 seconds&quot;</span><span class="o">})</span>

<span class="nv">$ </span>curl http://reading-time.samrat.me/api?url<span class="o">=</span>http://samrat.me/blog/2011/08/newsblur-an-awesome-alternative-to-google-reader
<span class="o">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;minutes&quot;</span>:1.0160000324249268,<span class="s2">&quot;readable&quot;</span>:<span class="s2">&quot;1 minutes, 0 seconds&quot;</span><span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Embedding Reading Time</h2>
<p>To embed Reading Time on this site, I'm using this short script that makes use of jQuery:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getJSON</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;http://www.reading-time.samrat.me/api?url=&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">href</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&amp;callback=?&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">{},</span>
<span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;div.rt_readable&quot;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Reading Time: &quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;div.rt_readable&quot;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">readable</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The script is also available at <a href="http://www.reading-time.samrat.me/js/embed_rt.js">http://www.reading-time.samrat.me/js/embed_rt.js</a>, so you can add it to your site by just adding a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> pointing to that link. Note that you'll also need to add <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> to your site <em>before</em> this script.</p>
<p>Now, all you need to do is add <code>&lt;div class='rt_readable'&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code> where you want Reading Time to appear. And when the page loads, you should see the Reading Time of the page. </p>

	<h2><a href="blog/2012/08/extracting-feed-articles-in-clojure" title="Permalink to Extracting feed articles in Clojure">Extracting feed articles in Clojure</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p>I'm reading <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do"><strong>Programming Collective Intelligence</strong></a> by <a href="http://kiwitobes.com/"><strong>Toby Segaran</strong></a> and doing the examples in Clojure. <em>Chapter 3</em> in the book shows you how to cluster similar blogs together using word-frequencies generated from their feeds. </p>
<p>Now, some blogs annoyingly give out just a link to the post or just a short blurb of the post in their feeds. That proved to be a major annoyance but I found a workaround to deal with it, which I will describe in this post. </p>
<p><em>(By the way, if you have a blog that publishes just links or blurbs, please consider changing your feed settings; you'll make a lot of people reading your blog using a feed reader, and a few programmers a lot happier)</em></p>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/scsibug/feedparser-clj"><strong>feedparser-clj</strong></a> to parse feeds in order to grab the whole article from the feed, I used <a href="https://github.com/jiminoc/goose">Goose</a>, which is a Scala library. Because of this, you can't simply start using Goose by just adding it as a Leiningen dependency. Thankfully, there is a tool, <a href="https://github.com/kumarshantanu/lein-localrepo"><code>lein-localrepo</code></a> that greatly simplifies installing Leiningen or Maven repos from a local file(as opposed to from clojars.org). After installing localrepo, you need to install Goose:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">lein</span> <span class="n">localrepo</span> <span class="n">coords</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">to</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">jar</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Which will give you something like <code>goose/target/goose-2.1.19.jar goose/goose 2.1.19</code>. Now, to actually install it:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">lein</span> <span class="n">localrepo</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">goose</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">target</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">goose</span><span class="o">-</span>2<span class="p">.</span>1<span class="p">.</span>19<span class="p">.</span><span class="n">jar</span> <span class="n">goose</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">goose</span> 2<span class="p">.</span>1<span class="p">.</span>19
</pre></div>


<p>Then, add <code>[com.gravity/goose "2.1.19"]</code> to your project dependencies. Now, if you open a REPL in the project dir(using <code>lein repl</code>), you should be able to import stuff from Goose:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nb">import </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">com.gravity.goose</span> <span class="nv">Goose</span> <span class="nv">Configuration</span> <span class="nv">Article</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To extract the article from a URL, type in a function:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">extract-article</span>
<span class="s">&quot;Extracts the article from url.&quot;</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">url</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">url</span>     <span class="nv">url</span>
    <span class="nv">goose</span>   <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">Goose.</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">Configuration.</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="nv">article</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">.extractContent</span> <span class="nv">goose</span> <span class="nv">url</span><span class="p">)]</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">.cleanedArticleText</span> <span class="nv">article</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Next, we will extract a list of blog post URLs:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use</span> <span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">feedparser-clj</span> <span class="ss">:exclude</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">-main</span><span class="p">)])</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">articles-list</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">feed-url</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">parsed</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">parse-feed</span> <span class="nv">feed-url</span><span class="p">)]</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map </span><span class="ss">:link</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:entries</span> <span class="nv">parsed</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, to get all the extracted articles from a feed, you can map <code>extract-article</code> to a list of article URLs:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map </span><span class="nv">extract-article</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">articles-list</span> <span class="s">&quot;http://samrat.me/feeds/all.xml&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

	<h2><a href="blog/2012/08/an-ide-as-a-packaged-chrome-app" title="Permalink to An IDE as a packaged Chrome app">An IDE as a packaged Chrome app</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p>Everyone is talking about how browsers are getting more powerful. With recent developments such as Google's V8 Javascript engine, web browsers are being viewed more and more as platforms and not as mere "document viewers" to the web. The Chromebook is probably the best example I can site of this paradigm shift.</p>
<p>Anyways as browsers become more powerful, attempts to create development environments based on browsers have also gotten more agressive. The most notable of these attempts is probably <a href="http://app.kodowa.com/playground">Light Table</a>, which is a really sleek IDE that runs on the browser. (Just to be accurate for Light Table, the actual "evaluation" of the code happens outside the browser)</p>
<p>Its first beta version that's called Light Table Playground was released a while back, and while the initial "pitch" had seemed really promising, <strong>I found that programming inside the browser was not something that I enjoyed doing</strong>. Well, I know that the guys working on Light Table are developing the tool as an in-browser tool. And I think an IDE that can talk to the Internet is the right way to go.</p>
<p>What I really want to see is an <strong>IDE that acts as first-class desktop app, but can still talk to the web</strong>, like most web apps. And yes, that would be something close to Chrome apps, but the Google Chrome team recently(it was about a month back) announced that Chrome apps are about to get an overhaul that is more along the lines of what I'm talking about:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lBUGTVIJVfM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Having such an app would feel comfortable while still leveraging the power of the mighty "clouds". Since I already keep my <code>code/</code> folder inside Dropbox, I'd say that the app could take Dropbox as a "role model". The app would be available offline, but when its online it would start syncing to its servers so you can access your code anywhere.</p>
<p>Ideally, the app would be a one-click install which would set up your development environment exactly as you've configured. And of course, there's bonus points for modeling this around Vim :)</p>

	<h2><a href="blog/2012/07/help-me-buy-a-domain-name" title="Permalink to Help me buy a domain name">Help me buy a domain name</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p><strong>UPDATE- <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Udo">Udo</a> on Hacker News was kind enough to buy me a domain. This site can now be reached at <a href="http://samrat.me">http://samrat.me</a>. Thanks a lot, Udo.</strong></p>
<p>I've got a problem. I want to buy a domain name for this website. But due to some banking regulations in my country, online payments cannot be made(for international transactions, at least.) Some companies <em>are</em> making money by buying products on Amazon and other online shops on behalf of people here, but they're limited to only physical goods. </p>
<p>This problem has been troubling me for a while, and I've come up with what could be a solution. Following all the recent buzz around Kickstarter- I decided to ask the Internet for help, but don't worry, <strong>I'm not asking for your money</strong>. </p>
<p>If you're still reading this and interested in helping <em>and if you happen to be a person who is about to buy a domain name</em>, you can support my cause by buying a domain name with my <a href="http://www.namecheap.com?aff=34707">affiliate link</a> on Namecheap. That way, a small percentage of what you spend on Namecheap might help me get a domain name for myself. But if you're not interested, no pressure, I can live without a domain name; just please don't take this the wrong way.</p>
<p>If you're interested in helping but not looking to register a domain name right now, you could bookmark the link above and use that to make your purchase later. As you can probably tell, I haven't used Namecheap but I've heard they're great!</p>
<p>Thank you :)</p>
