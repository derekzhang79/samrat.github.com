	</hgroup>
	<p>Everyone is talking about how browsers are getting more powerful. With recent developments such as Google's V8 Javascript engine, web browsers are being viewed more and more as platforms and not as mere "document viewers" to the web. The Chromebook is probably the best example I can site of this paradigm shift.</p>
<p>Anyways as browsers become more powerful, attempts to create development environments based on browsers have also gotten more agressive. The most notable of these attempts is probably <a href="http://app.kodowa.com/playground">Light Table</a>, which is a really sleek IDE that runs on the browser. (Just to be accurate for Light Table, the actual "evaluation" of the code happens outside the browser)</p>
<p>Its first beta version that's called Light Table Playground was released a while back, and while the initial "pitch" had seemed really promising, <strong>I found that programming inside the browser was not something that I enjoyed doing</strong>. Well, I know that the guys working on Light Table are developing the tool as an in-browser tool. And I think an IDE that can talk to the Internet is the right way to go.</p>
<p>What I really want to see is an <strong>IDE that acts as first-class desktop app, but can still talk to the web</strong>, like most web apps. And yes, that would be something close to Chrome apps, but the Google Chrome team recently(it was about a month back) announced that Chrome apps are about to get an overhaul that is more along the lines of what I'm talking about:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lBUGTVIJVfM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Having such an app would feel comfortable while still leveraging the power of the mighty "clouds". Since I already keep my <code>code/</code> folder inside Dropbox, I'd say that the app could take Dropbox as a "role model". The app would be available offline, but when its online it would start syncing to its servers so you can access your code anywhere.</p>
<p>Ideally, the app would be a one-click install which would set up your development environment exactly as you've configured. And of course, there's bonus points for modeling this around Vim :)</p>

	</hgroup>
	<p><strong>UPDATE- <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Udo">Udo</a> on Hacker News was kind enough to buy me a domain. This site can now be reached at <a href="http://samrat.me">http://samrat.me</a>. Thanks a lot, Udo.</strong></p>
<p>I've got a problem. I want to buy a domain name for this website. But due to some banking regulations in my country, online payments cannot be made(for international transactions, at least.) Some companies <em>are</em> making money by buying products on Amazon and other online shops on behalf of people here, but they're limited to only physical goods. </p>
<p>This problem has been troubling me for a while, and I've come up with what could be a solution. Following all the recent buzz around Kickstarter- I decided to ask the Internet for help, but don't worry, <strong>I'm not asking for your money</strong>. </p>
<p>If you're still reading this and interested in helping <em>and if you happen to be a person who is about to buy a domain name</em>, you can support my cause by buying a domain name with my <a href="http://www.namecheap.com?aff=34707">affiliate link</a> on Namecheap. That way, a small percentage of what you spend on Namecheap might help me get a domain name for myself. But if you're not interested, no pressure, I can live without a domain name; just please don't take this the wrong way.</p>
<p>If you're interested in helping but not looking to register a domain name right now, you could bookmark the link above and use that to make your purchase later. As you can probably tell, I haven't used Namecheap but I've heard they're great!</p>
<p>Thank you :)</p>

	<p>If you've been following the tech world recently you'd know that Apple and Google haven't been the best of friends lately. You know, because Google ripped off Apple the same way Microsoft had ripped them off back when the PC boom was kicking off. There's a statement by Steve Jobs in his biography which can only be regarded as a declaration of war on Google. And we are starting to actually see this war taking place- a few weeks ago, Apple declared that the new iOS will come with its own 'Google Maps'-like service instead of Google Maps.</p>
<p>And now, Google too has announced its answer to what was iOS 5's most famous addition- Siri. It's not exactly like Siri- in fact, Google has tried to go a step further and make a more smarter system. If Google succeeds in rolling out Project Glass then Google Now will be a pretty nifty feature for it too. Watch the video below to find out what Now is all about:</p>

	<h2><a href="blog/2012/06/a-first-look-at-provisioning-with-puppeton-a-vagrant-box" title="Permalink to A first look at provisioning with Puppet(on a Vagrant box)">A first look at provisioning with Puppet(on a Vagrant box)</a></h2>
	
	</hgroup>
	<p>In my <a href="http://samrat.github.com/blog/2012/05/flask-nginx-gunicornon-a-vagrant-box/">previous post</a>, I talked about deploying a Flask app on a Vagrant box using Gunicorn and Nginx. The response I got was mind-blowing, so I've decided to write about another neat tool that's awesome for deploying web apps- Puppet. <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> actually encourages its users to use it, and you should use it. <strong>There's also an alternative to Puppet called <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a>; some people prefer that over Puppet, so you might want to check it out.</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully I'll be able to demonstrate what Puppet does and why its awesome in this post. But please note that this isn't meant as a comprehensive tutorial, you should check out Puppet's <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/">docs</a> for that. Also even though the Puppet docs asks you to get the Learning Puppet VM, I found it much more comfortable to use <code>vagrant ssh</code> for learning Puppet, so if you already have Vagraant installed, you might want to try that out too- just try running <code>puppet</code> inside the virtual machine. </p>
<p>What Puppet does is something called <em>provisioning</em>- that means that it <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP8Mtiuc8XM">makes computers do what they are supposed to do</a></em>. In other words, it does the configuring for you. To understand what that means, let's see it in action.</p>
<p>First create a Vagrant box, </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">mkdir</span> <span class="n">codebase_with_puppet</span>
<span class="n">cd</span> <span class="n">codebase_with_puppet</span>

<span class="n">vagrant</span> <span class="n">init</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You should now see Vagrantfile. Open it with a text editor, then uncomment the lines</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">vm</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">provision</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="n">puppet</span> <span class="n">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">puppet</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="n">puppet</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">manifests_path</span> <span class="p">=</span> &quot;<span class="n">manifests</span>&quot;
    <span class="n">puppet</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">manifest_file</span>  <span class="p">=</span> &quot;<span class="n">base</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">pp</span>&quot;
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, create <code>base.pp</code> inside a folder called manifests, and add the following to it.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">package</span> <span class="p">{</span>&quot;<span class="n">nginx</span>&quot;<span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">ensure</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">present</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, run <code>vagrant up</code>. You'll notice that Vagrant automatically installs <code>nginx</code> after it boots the VM. You should get a message like </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">notice</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">Stage</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">Package</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">nginx</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">ensure</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">ensure</span> <span class="n">changed</span> <span class="s">&#39;purged&#39;</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="s">&#39;present&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This can become a real treasure as this way, you won't have to memorize what you need to install, to get the app running. All the system needs is to have <code>puppet</code> installed, after that <code>puppet</code> with the right manifests will handle everything. </p>
<p>Now, let's do something different with Puppet- instead of installing another package, we'll use it to configure <code>nginx</code>. </p>
<p>First, create a file in your local machine, inside <code>codebase_with_puppet</code> called <code>codebase_nginx</code>. To that file add the following</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">server</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kn">location</span> <span class="s">/</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kn">proxy_pass</span> <span class="s">http://127.0.0.1:8000</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you've gone through the <a href="http://samrat.github.com/blog/2012/05/flask-nginx-gunicornon-a-vagrant-box/">previous post</a> you'll notice that it's the same configuration that we had used. </p>
<p>Now, we'll use Puppet to make sure that the configuration file is placed where its supposed to be. To your <code>base.pp</code> file, add </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">file</span> <span class="p">{</span>&quot;<span class="n">rm</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">nginx</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">default</span>&quot;<span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">path</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s">&#39;/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">ensure</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">absent</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">require</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">Package</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;nginx&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">file</span> <span class="p">{</span>&quot;<span class="n">setup</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">nginx</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">codebase</span>&quot;<span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">path</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s">&#39;/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/codebase_nginx&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">ensure</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">present</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">require</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">Package</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;nginx&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="n">source</span> <span class="p">=</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> &quot;<span class="o">/</span><span class="n">vagrant</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">codebase_nginx</span>&quot;<span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Run <code>vagrant reload</code> and you're done with the <code>nginx</code> configuration. Besides removing the repetitiveness for you, Puppet is also wonderful when you're working on a team or on an open-source project. Now, all you need to do is write the manifests and once you share them you can rest assured that the entire team has the exact same environment.<br />
