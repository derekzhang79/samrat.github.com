	<p>Innovation is really hard to find in a developing nation. Innovation requires taking risks because when you’re innovating you are, by definition, doing things in a way that is unconventional. And taking risks in a developing nation is hard. Firstly because in a developing country the people’s first priority is to achieve financial security. Thus, many end up getting a safe job with a large corporation than risking their money by starting an enterprise. However, although that may lead to a secure future, it definitely doesn’t lead to prosperity, both for the individual and the nation. </p>
<p>So, how can a developing nation cultivate a culture of innovation? Now, I know that a lot of people will say that the government should improve its policies to become more entrepreneur-friendly. Yes, in most developing nations governmental policies and governments can become huge setbacks to entrepreneurship; in fact, that’s probably the reason why they are developing nations in the first place. But what we must realize is that governmental policies are unlikely to change anytime soon. So whatever can be done has to be from our side. </p>
<p>The answer, in my opinion, to improve the startup scene in any nation is to <em>start small</em>. Entrepreneurs and innovators need to learn how to start small and make the best of the resources they have available. This is actually quite easy for web startups these days, as so much software is available for free online. Also, services like Amazon EC2 make it extremely cheap to create websites that can scale in response to the popularity it gains. </p>
<p><em>Bootstrapping</em> is a word that has caught on a lot recently, and not without good reason. Traditionally, the way to start a business was to raise a lot of capital and then start making and selling your stuff. Bootstrapping, on the other hand, means starting with very little cash and then turning those small investments into a profit. That’s the way a lot of today’s big companies like Apple, Google and Facebook did it. (Of course, they all raised money later from investors so that they could grow even larger.) </p>
<p>However, the most important part of innovating or starting a business is <em>solving problems</em>- actual problems. A lot of web startups these days solve what have properly been coined the name first world problems and they aren’t really problems, at least not compared to the third world problems. Now, if you want your creation to survive in a poor developing nation, then your creation better be good. One good example of a company solving an actual problem is <a href="http://harilo.com" title="Harilo">Harilo</a>. People in Nepal can’t order from stores like Amazon.com so the guys at Harilo created a service which allowed them to. It may not be a totally new idea(I’ve seen another Indian website offering a similar service) but its opened up a whole new world of online shopping in Nepal. </p>
<p>Innovation is something citizens of developing nations must indulge in- it’s the only way we’ll be able to move forward. We are already part of the wonderful world the Internet has made possible and now is the best time to join the league of people whose beautiful creations shape this world. </p>
