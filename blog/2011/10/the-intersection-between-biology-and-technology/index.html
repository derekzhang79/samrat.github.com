	<div class="rt_readable"> </div>
	<p>Towards the end of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451648537/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=samrat09-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1451648537">'Steve Jobs' by Walter Isaacson</a>(the Steve Jobs bio), there's a quote by Steve Jobs that says something along the line of "The greatest advancements we will see in the twenty-first century will come from the <em>intersection of biology and technology</em>." Since this comes from a visionary who foresaw and made possible so many of today's great technologies and products, this statement is particularly hard to ignore. </p>
<p>So I began to wonder what these advancements would be like. Well, I got all sorts of ideas of what kind of innovations we could be expecting- nanobots fighting cancer cells, cyborgs(or maybe just enhanced human bodies), longer lifetimes, and lots of other fancy ideas. But, pretty soon I began wondering how much of these innovations would come from hackers. Many of the digital age's greatest innovations came from hackers working in their parents garage, so will we see any innovations in this era of "the intersection of biology and technology" coming from teenagers working on their own? Or will almost all of these innovations come from high-tech research labs?</p>
<p>Hackers in the digital age innovated by tinkering. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> practically taught himself to build computers. A really large portion of programmers are self taught. But, will we see guys who taught themselves to, say, sequence the DNA? Or someone who created nanobots that could enter our blood streams and fight diseases? Tinkering with electronics or software requires easily available resources like electronics components or just a computer. If you want to start tinkering with biotech, however, you'll arguably require much sophisticated devices. Also, security issues like bioterrorism arise when anyone can have access to these resources. </p>
<p>Biology-hackers will probably have a much harder time getting the resources they need than the computer hackers did, but even if they did get the resources, the products or research they come up with is unlikely to become something really big. Because for one thing, no one would really trust products coming from college dropouts hacking in a garage enough to have have anything to do with their bodies. </p>
<p>So, we probably won't see much direct contribution from hackers in this field. That is a really sad thing, given that they played such a huge role in the digital revolution. But who knows, maybe something will come along that will change this, somehting like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800">Altair 8800</a> for the PC revolution. </p>
